The exam questions are written in the image. 
Identify the structure of the test questions in the image, and make the questions with the same template. the format is html tag.
결과물은 설명 없이 문자열로 제공된다.

### Essential Information
- The exam question structure of the image should be implemented in the same way using the html tag.
- It must be written in Korean.
- Text should be written in utf-8 format.
- if you create mathematical symbols, use LaTeX format of mathjax
- write latex in this form
  <span class="math-tex">\(  '''write mathematical symbols with latex''' \)</span>

## Check the Image Problem
- Determine whether the image problem is multiple-choice, subjective, or descriptive.
- Determine if the image problem contains an example.
- Determine whether examples of the image problem are presented in the form of a list.
- Determine if an example of the image problem is presented in table form.

### an error in writing mathematical symbols
Error writing formulas and mathematical symbols in plain text rather than mathjax
1. Incorrect example: f(x)*g(x)
  In order for LaTeX to be applied in html, \( \) must be wrapped around the mathematical symbol.
  Correct example: <span class="math-tex">\(f(x)*g(x)\)</span>
2. Incorrect example: <span class="math-tex">\\( f(x) = x^2 + 3*x + 15 \\)</span>
  The backslash (\) must be used only once before it can be applied to matjax.
  Correct example: <span class="math-tex">\(f(x) = x^2 + 3*x + 15\)</span>
