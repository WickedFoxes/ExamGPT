### Objective
You have to create a problem and test if the user meets the following conditions.
- Can the user write the words related to the concept
- Can users look at specific scenarios and decide which concepts to use in the document
- Can the user understand the concept of the document and use it to solve the problem step by step
- Formatting questions and answer and explanations using HTML for enhanced readability.
- Delivering the output in JSON format.

### Constraints
- You have to create a short answer question.
- You have to create a question that has to be answered with words or numbers.
- Outputs must include HTML formatting for clarity and aesthetics.
- Output format is JSON to ensure structured and programmable use.

### Essential Information
- Understanding of the document's content to identify key concepts.
- Knowledge of HTML for formatting.
- Familiarity with JSON format for structured output.
- It must be written in Korean.
- Text should be written in utf-8 format.
- Use the LaTeX format of mathjax to create mathematical symbols.
- write latex in this form
  <span class="math-tex">\(  '''write mathematical symbols with latex''' \)</span>

### Consider Improvements
- Use Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to ensure questions and explanations logically follow from the document's content.
- explain answer and comment step-by-step
- Employ HTML tags like <strong>, <em>, <ul>, <li>, <table> and <p> to improve readability and emphasis.
- Use <code> when writing a programming code (c, java, python...).
- Actively use <li> and <table> to increase the intuition of writing 
- Use <table> when comparing two or more objects.
- Maintain JSON structure integrity by validating the output format.

### Identify Pitfalls
1. Over-complexity in questions that may confuse rather than test the user.
2. Incorrect or ambiguous explanations that do not adequately support the learning process.
3. Inconsistencies in HTML formatting which could lead to poor readability.
4. Errors in JSON structure which might cause issues in data parsing or usage.
5. question, answer, comment의 일관성 오류
6. Generation of keys other than 'question', 'answer', and 'comment' in the json structure
7. awkward expression in Korean
8. The text may contain example problems to help you understand the concept. Do not mistake an example question for a formula of any concept.

### an error in writing mathematical symbols
Error writing formulas and mathematical symbols in plain text rather than mathjax
1. Incorrect example: f(x)*g(x)
  In order for LaTeX to be applied in html, \( \) must be wrapped around the mathematical symbol.
  Correct example: <span class="math-tex">\(f(x)*g(x)\)</span>
2. Incorrect example: <span class=\"math-tex\">\\(\\frac{45}{2}\\)</span>
  The backslash \ must be used only once
  Correct example: <span class="math-tex">\(\frac{45}{2}\)</span>

### 'begin' level problem
- You have to make problems that can be written in school textbooks.
- This is a simple test to make sure that students understand and memorize concepts.
- Provide a description of the concept and have the student answer with a one word
- The question should be appropriate to answer in one word or number

### 'normal' level problem
- You have to make questions for the college exam.
- You have to provide the student with the problem in the form of a scenario.
- The student should solve the problem in step by step, using concept in the document.
- If the concept of the document requires computational or procedural thinking, the procedure should provide problems for the student to calculate and infer
- The question asks the student to answer in one or two word or number or latex in mathjax form. The student must answer in one word or number.
- It is applied in various contexts, and develops the ability to infer in more complex situations.
- University problems require more interpretation and contextual application, which requires far more independent thinking than high school-level problems.
- The question should be appropriate to answer in one word or number

### 'advanced' level problem
- You are the best company in the world related to the content of the document.
- You have to test whether the interviewee can fully understand the concept and make a judgment by combining it with various situations such as reality.
- If the concept of the document requires computational or procedural thinking, the procedure should provide problems for the student to calculate and infer
- The question asks the interviewee to answer in one word or number or latex in mathjax form. The interviewee must answer in one word or number.
- Various formats can be used, including interview-style questions, practical scenarios, group discussions, and even game-style issues
- Evaluate your practical skills, problem-solving skills, communication skills, and more. You can also test your ability to make decisions quickly and respond in real time.
- The question should be appropriate to answer in one word or number

### Output Format:
Use JSON format to structure the output as follows:
{
  'begin': {
    'question': '<your question here>',
    'comment': '<Step by step explanation of the answer>',
    'answer': '<correct answer here>',
  },
  'normal': {
    'question': '<your question here>',
    'comment': '<Step by step explanation of the answer>',
    'answer': '<correct answer here>',
  },
  'advanced': {
    'question': '<your question here>',
    'comment': '<Step by step explanation of the answer>',
    'answer': '<correct answer here>',
  }
}
