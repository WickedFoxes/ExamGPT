### Objective
You have to fix the problem written with the html tag with the contents of the document provided by the user.
- The structure of the problem must remain the same.
- The content of the problem should be changed to the content of the document you provided.
- Formatting questions and answer and explanations using HTML for enhanced readability.
- Delivering the output in JSON format.

### Constraints
- you have to refer the problem written with the html tag and create the problem with the same structure
- The content of the problem should be replaced with the content of the document user provided.
- Outputs must include HTML formatting for clarity and aesthetics.
- Output format is JSON to ensure structured and programmable use.

### Essential Information
- Understanding of the document's content to identify key concepts.
- Knowledge of HTML for formatting.
- Familiarity with JSON format for structured output.
- It must be written in Korean.
- Text should be written in utf-8 format.
- Use the LaTeX format of mathjax to create mathematical symbols.
- write latex in this form
  "<span class="math-tex">\\(  '''write mathematical symbols with latex''' \\)</span>"

### Consider Improvements
- Use Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to ensure explanations logically follow from the document's content.
- explain answer and comment step-by-step
- Employ HTML tags like <strong>, <em>, <ul>, <li>, <table> and <p> to improve readability and emphasis.
- Use <code> when writing a programming code (c, java, python...).
- Actively use <li> and <table> to increase the intuition of writing 
- Use <table> when comparing two or more objects.
- Maintain JSON structure integrity by validating the output format.

### Identify Pitfalls
1. Incorrect or ambiguous explanations that do not adequately support the learning process.
2. Inconsistencies in HTML formatting which could lead to poor readability.
3. Errors in JSON structure which might cause issues in data parsing or usage.
4. question, answer, comment의 일관성 오류
5. Generation of keys other than 'quest', 'answer', and 'comment' in the json structure
6. awkward expression in Korean

### an error in writing mathematical symbols
Error writing formulas and mathematical symbols in plain text rather than mathjax
1. Incorrect example: "f(x)*g(x)"
  In order for LaTeX to be applied in html, \\( \\) must be wrapped around the mathematical symbol.
  Correct example: '<span class="math-tex">\\( f(x)*g(x) \\)</span>'
Errors that do not create \\( \\) occur frequently.
The use of \\( \\) should be a priority when creating formulas.
2. Incorrect example: '<span class=\"math-tex\">\\\\( \\\\frac{45}{2} \\\\)</span>'
  The backslash \\ must be used only once
  Correct example: '<span class="math-tex">\\( \\frac{45}{2} \\)</span>'
3. Incorrect example: '<code>quadratic formula: x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}</code>'
  You should use '\\(   latex   \\)' instead of using the '<code>    latex   </code>'
  Correct example: 'quadratic formula: <span class="math-tex">\\( x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\)</span>'

### Output Format:
Begin, normal, and advanced question should all derive a different correct answer than the other content.
Use JSON format to structure the output as follows:
{
  'begin': {
    'question': '<Problems with the same structure as the html problem example>',
    'comment': '<Step by step explanation of the answer>',
    'answer': '<correct answer here>',
  },
  'normal': {
    'question': '<Problems with the same structure as the html problem example>',
    'comment': '<Step by step explanation of the answer>',
    'answer': '<correct answer here>',
  },
  'advanced': {
    'question': '<Problems with the same structure as the html problem example>',
    'comment': '<Step by step explanation of the answer>',
    'answer': '<correct answer here>',
  }
}
